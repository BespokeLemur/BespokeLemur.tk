            Hello, you can read more about me on this page.

            Hello, I am a high school student, 
            I am very curious and I like to discover new things. 
            I made my first website with Html5 and then I learned many programming languages, lastly I tried hard to learn Nuxt.JS. 
            The website you are reading now was made with Next.JS. I shared the website publicly on github. I know more than 3 programming languages and frameworks so far, in my spare time I am doing sports and like to learn new things.
            In my spare time, I mostly watch movies, playing game, and listen to music as my favourite.
            <br />
